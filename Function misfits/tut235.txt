1. Both global and static variables have static storage duration. they live throughout the entire lifetime of the program.

2. Static variables are scoped to the function in which they are declared and used. If you try to access them outside that function you'll get a compiler error.

3. Global variablesare scoped to the global scope to the file where they are declared. They are accessible and usable through out the entire life.
