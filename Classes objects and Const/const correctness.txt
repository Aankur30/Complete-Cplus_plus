                Const Correctness

1. For const objects you can obly call const member functions.

2.Const objects are completely non-modifiable(immutable). The compiler won't allow calling a member function that modifies the const objects in any way

3. We are not allowed to modify the object in any way inside const member function.

4.Just as we're not allowed to directly modify the object inside a const member function, we're not allowed to cal a method that modifies the object indirectly either.

5.Any attempt to modify an object's member variable(direct or indirectly) from within a const member functions will result in a compiler error

6. You cannot call any non-const member function from within a const member function
